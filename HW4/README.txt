The code can be downloaded from https://github.com/gpalat3/CSE7641
Download the HW4 folder or execute the git clone command - https://github.com/gpalat3/CSE7641.git

The following libraries are needed prior to running the code. This code can be run on python 3.7 and higher.
1) numpy
2) gym
3) matplotlib
4) mdptoolbox

The two MDPs are to be run individually.
If running on the command line, navigate to the path where the files are downloaded (under HW2) and then run the following commands.
1) python FrozenLake.py
2) python Forest.py

All the plots will be generated in the plots folder. There should be two directories under plots --> Forest and FrozenLake.
