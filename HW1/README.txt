The code can be downloaded from https://github.com/gpalat3/CSE7641
Download the HW1 folder or execute the git clone command - https://github.com/gpalat3/CSE7641.git

The following libraries are needed prior to running the code. This code can be run on python 3.6 and higher.
1) numpy
2) pandas
3) math
4) time
5) matplotlib
6) sklearn
7) tensorflow
8) keras

The models are to be run individually. 
If running on the command line, navigate to the path where the files are downloaded (under HW1) and then run the following commands. 
1) python DecisionTree.py
2) python AdaBoost.py
3) python KNN.py
4) python NeuralNetwork.py
5) python SVMLinear.py
6) python SVMrbf.py

The data needed is present in the data folder and all the plots will be generated in the plots folder.
