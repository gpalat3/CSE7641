The code can be downloaded from https://github.com/gpalat3/CSE7641
Download the HW3 folder or execute the git clone command - https://github.com/gpalat3/CSE7641.git

The following libraries are needed prior to running the code. This code can be run on python 3.7 and higher.
1) numpy
2) pandas
3) math
4) time
5) matplotlib
6) sklearn
7) seaborn

The clustering and dimensionality reduction problems are to be run individually.
If running on the command line, navigate to the path where the files are downloaded (under HW2) and then run the following commands.
1) python KMeans.py
2) python EM.py
3) python PCA.py
4) python ICA.py
5) python GRP.py
6) python MBDL.py
7) python PCAWithClustering.py
8) python ICAWithClustering.py
9) python GRPWithClustering.py
10) python MBDLWithClustering.py
11) python NeuralNetwork.py

The data needed is present in the data folder and all the plots will be generated in the plots folder.
